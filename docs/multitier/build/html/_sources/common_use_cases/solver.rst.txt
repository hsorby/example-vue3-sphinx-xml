Simulation tool developer: Solver
=================================
The code generation functionality in libCellML can be used to transform CellML models into procedural code for simulation.
This example works through that process.

Create a placeholder for the solver
-----------------------------------
Interacting with procedural code means that we need a program, so the first step is to create what will soon become our solver.
To start with, the program only reads and interprets command line arguments; the size and number of timesteps to simulate.
This is done using a simple function, as below.
